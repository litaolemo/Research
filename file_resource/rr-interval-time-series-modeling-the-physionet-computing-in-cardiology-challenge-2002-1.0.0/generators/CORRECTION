Thanks to Corinna Raab for pointing out an error in the attributions
of the time series used in the challenge.  The generator written by
D.C. Lin was used to create series rr10 and rr37 (not rr27 and rr43,
as previously indicated).

Series rr28 and rr45, as Corinna also observes, are synthetic, but
were not generated by any of the programs in this directory.
